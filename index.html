     <h2>1.Difference Between Div and Span</h2> 

     <p>HTML (div) tag: The div tag is known as Division tag. The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content on the web page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc). 
     Div tag has both opening(div) and closing (div) tags and it is mandatory to close the tag. As we know Div tag is a block-level tag. In this example, the div tag contains the entire width. 
     It will be displayed div tag each time on a new line, not on the same line.</p>
   
      <p>HTML (span) tag: The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. It used to group elements for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes). 
      A better way to use it when no other semantic element is available. The span tag is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag.</p> 

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>2. Difference between class and IDs</h2>
        <p>Difference between id and class attribute: The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements. </p>
    </div>

      <h2>3. What are self closing tags</h2>
      <p>The HTML (BR) tag is used to create a line break in the text. It is typically employed in poems or addresses where line division is required. It is an empty tag, which means it contains no content and is referred to as a void element. Including the (BR) tag in the HTML code functions similarly to pressing the enter key in a word processor.</p>
      <p>The HTML (HR) tag is used to insert a horizontal rule or a paragraph-level thematic break in a Html document to split or separate document sections. It is used when the topic of your HTML content abruptly changes. It divides them by drawing a horizontal line. The (HR) tag is an empty tag that does not require a closing tag. For example, a change of scene in a story or a switch of the topic within a segment.</p>
      <p>The HTML (IMG) tag is used to display or embed an image on the web page. The HTML image element is an inline and empty element that only includes attributes; closing tags are not used in the image element.</p>
      <p>The HTML (INPUT) tag is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms to accept data from the user; depending on the device and user agent, a wide variety of input data and control widgets are accessible. The element is among the most powerful and complex in all HTML tags due to the vast amount of input types and attribute combinations. It is used inside the (form) element to declare input controls that allow users to enter data. (label) can be used to define labels for the input element.</p>
      <p>The HTML (LINK) tag is used to establish a connection between a current document and an external resource. The link tag is mainly used to connect to external sheets and establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices), among other things. This element can appear more than once, but it only appears in the head section. The link element's values indicate how the item is linked to and is related to the containing page.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>4. How many types of headings are there?How to decide which to use where </h2>
        <p>HTML defines six levels of headings, and these heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6. The H1 element is the highest or most important level, and the H6 element is the least important. These different heading levels help to communicate the organization and hierarchy of the content on a page.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>5. Difference between block and inline</h2>
        <p>The inline and block elements in HTML, which are default display values. The most used block element tag is (div) tag and inline element tags are (a), (span) tags.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>6. Difference between em and strong</h2>
        <p>The (strong) tag should be used to indicate strong importance, seriousness, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it.</p> 
        <p>The (em) tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>7. What are attributes?</h2>
        <p>The (a) tag defines a hyperlink. The (href) attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.</p>
        <p>The (img) tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The (src) attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:</p>
        <p>Attributes provide additional information about elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value.</p>
